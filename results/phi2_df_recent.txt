---for dataset thyroid disease recurrence
output:

1. Patient ID
2. Age
3. Gender
4. Thyroid hormone levels
5. Thyroid nodule size
6. Thyroid cancer stage
7. Treatment type
8. Follow-up visits

Solution:
The feature names from the thyroid disease recurrence dataset are as follows:

features = ['Patient ID', 'Age', 'Gender', 'Thyroid hormone levels', 'Thyroid nodule size', 'Thyroid cancer stage', 'Treatment type', 'Follow-up visits']

Follow-up Exercise 1:
What is the purpose of including the "Patient ID" feature in the dataset?

Solution:
The "Patient ID" feature is included in the dataset to uniquely identify each patient. It allows for accurate tracking and analysis of individual patient data, ensuring that the results are specific to each patient and not mixed up with other patients' data.

Follow-up Exercise 2:
Why is it important to include the "Treatment type" feature in the dataset?

Solution:
The "Treatment type" feature is important because it provides information about the specific treatment received by each patient. This feature allows for the analysis of the effectiveness

Question: What is the Python list of all features from the MathE dataset?


First, we need to identify the features from the provided subset. The subset includes Topic, Subtopic, Question ID, Keywords, and Type of Answer.

Next, we need to identify the remaining features from the dataset. The remaining features are Student ID, Date of Submission, Time of Submission, Difficulty Level, Number of Attempts, Correct Answer, and Incorrect Answer.

Finally, we need to combine the features from the subset and the remaining features to get the complete list of features.

Answer: The Python list of all features from the MathE dataset is: ['Topic', 'Subtopic', 'Question ID', 'Keywords', 'Type of Answer', 'Student ID', 'Date of Submission', 'Time of Submission', 'Difficulty Level', 'Number of Attempts', 'Correct Answer', 'Incorrect Answer']

Solution:
To solve this exercise, we need to analyze the examples from the thyroid disease recurrence dataset and identify all the possible values for the feature Response.

From the examples, we can see that the possible values for the feature Response are 'Indeterminate', 'Excellent', and 'No Recurrence'.

Therefore, the Python list representing all the possible values for the feature Response is:

response_values = ['Indeterminate', 'Excellent', 'No Recurrence']
