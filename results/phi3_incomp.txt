The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
The `seen_tokens` attribute is deprecated and will be removed in v4.41. Use the `cache_position` model input instead.
You are not running the flash-attention implementation, expect numerical differences.
