The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
The `seen_tokens` attribute is deprecated and will be removed in v4.41. Use the `cache_position` model input instead.
You are not running the flash-attention implementation, expect numerical differences.

Thyroid Disease Recurrence Dataset Analysis


Introduction

Thyroid diseases are common endocrine disorders that can lead to significant morbidity. Recurrence of thyroid disease after treatment is a concern for both patients and healthcare providers. This document outlines the analysis of a dataset containing information on patients who have experienced a recurrence of thyroid disease. The dataset includes various features that are crucial for understanding the factors associated with disease recurrence.


Dataset Overview

The dataset comprises 500 patient records with the following features:

- Patient_ID: A unique identifier for each patient.

- Age: The age of the patient at the time of recurrence.

- G
