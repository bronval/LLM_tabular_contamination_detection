### FEATURES UNINFORMED TEST ###


---for dataset adult income
output:
The Adult Income dataset, often referred to as the "Adult" dataset or the "Census Income" dataset, is a popular dataset for machine learning tasks, particularly for predicting whether an individual earns more than $50,000 a year based on census data. The dataset contains various demographic and employment-related features. As of my last update, the features in the Adult Income dataset are as follows:

```python
features = [
    "age",
    "workclass",
    "fnlwgt",
    "education",
    "education-num",
    "marital-status",
    "occupation",
    "relationship",
    "race",
    "sex",
    "capital-gain",
    "capital-loss",
    "hours-per-week",
    "native-country",
    "income"
]
```

Note: The "income" feature is often the target variable for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict if an individual earns more than $50,000 a year (`">50K"`) or less than or equal to $50,000 a year (`"<=50K"`).
Expected:
['age', 'workclass', 'fnlwgt', 'education', 'education.num', 'marital.status', 'occupation', 'relationship', 'race', 'sex', 'capital.gain', 'capital.loss', 'hours.per.week', 'native.country', 'income']
matches:
{'workclass': True, 'fnlwgt': True, 'education.num': False, 'marital.status': False, 'capital.gain': False, 'capital.loss': False, 'hours.per.week': False, 'native.country': False}
decision: True




---for dataset bank marketing
output:
The bank marketing dataset, commonly associated with direct marketing campaigns of Portuguese banking institutions, typically includes a variety of features related to client information, campaign details, and economic indicators. While the exact features can vary slightly depending on the version of the dataset, a standard set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository includes the following:

```python
features = [
    "age",                 # Age of the client
    "job",                 # Type of job (categorical: 'admin.', 'blue-collar', etc.)
    "marital",             # Marital status (categorical: 'married', 'single', 'divorced')
    "education",           # Education level (categorical: 'basic.4y', 'high.school', etc.)
    "default",             # Has credit in default? (binary: 'yes', 'no')
    "housing",             # Has housing loan? (binary: 'yes', 'no')
    "loan",                # Has personal loan? (binary: 'yes', 'no')
    "contact",             # Contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular', 'telephone')
    "month",               # Last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
    "day_of_week",         # Last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon', 'tue', 'wed', 'thu', 'fri')
    "duration",            # Last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
    "campaign",            # Number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
    "pdays",               # Number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
    "previous",            # Number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
    "poutcome",            # Outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure', 'nonexistent', 'success')
    "emp.var.rate",        # Employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
    "cons.price.idx",      # Consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
    "cons.conf.idx",       # Consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
    "euribor3m",           # Euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
    "nr.employed",         # Number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)
    "y"                    # Has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes', 'no')
]
```

This list represents a comprehensive overview of the features typically found in the bank marketing dataset. It's important to note that the `duration` feature, although included for completeness, should not be used as a predictor for building a realistic model, as mentioned in the dataset's documentation.
