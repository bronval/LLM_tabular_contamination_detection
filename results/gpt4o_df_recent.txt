### FEATURES UNINFORMED TEST ###


---for dataset thyroid disease recurrence
output:
To provide a list of features from the thyroid disease recurrence dataset, I would need specific information about the dataset you are referring to, as there are multiple datasets related to thyroid disease, each with its own set of features. However, I can provide a general example of what features might be included in a typical thyroid disease dataset. If you have a specific dataset in mind, please provide more details or a description of the dataset.

Here is an example list of features that might be found in a thyroid disease dataset:

```python
features = [
    "age",
    "sex",
    "on_thyroxine",
    "query_on_thyroxine",
    "on_antithyroid_medication",
    "sick",
    "pregnant",
    "thyroid_surgery",
    "I131_treatment",
    "query_hypothyroid",
    "query_hyperthyroid",
    "lithium",
    "goitre",
    "tumor",
    "hypopituitary",
    "psych",
    "TSH",
    "T3",
    "TT4",
    "T4U",
    "FTI",
    "TBG",
    "referral_source"
]
```

Please adjust the list according to
Expected:
['Age', 'Gender', 'Smoking', 'Hx Smoking', 'Hx Radiothreapy', 'Thyroid Function', 'Physical Examination', 'Adenopathy', 'Pathology', 'Focality', 'Risk', 'T', 'N', 'M', 'Stage', 'Response', 'Recurred']
matches:
{'Hx Smoking': False, 'Hx Radiothreapy': False, 'Thyroid Function': False, 'Physical Examination': False, 'Adenopathy': False, 'Focality': False}
decision: False




---for dataset MathE
output:
I'm sorry, but I don't have direct access to external datasets like MathE, so I can't provide a list of features from it. However, if you have access to the dataset, you can easily extract the feature names using a library like pandas in Python. Here's a general example of how you might do that:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
# df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')

# Get the list of feature names
# feature_names = df.columns.tolist()

# Print the feature names
# print(feature_names)
```

Replace `'path_to_your_dataset.csv'` with the actual path to your dataset file. This will give you a list of all the column names (features) in the dataset. If you have more specific information or a sample of the dataset, I can help you further with that.
Expected:
['Student Country', 'Question ID', 'Type of Answer', 'Question Level', 'Topic', 'Subtopic', 'Keywords']
matches:
{'Student Country': False, 'Question ID': False, 'Type of Answer': False, 'Question Level': False}
decision: False





### FEATURES INFORMED TEST ###


---for dataset thyroid disease recurrence
output:
To provide the remaining feature names from the thyroid disease recurrence dataset, I would need access to the complete dataset or a detailed description of all its features. However, since I don't have access to external databases or the complete dataset, I can suggest a general approach to identify the remaining features:

1. **Check Dataset Documentation**: If you have access to the dataset documentation or a data dictionary, it will list all the features and their descriptions.

2. **Explore the Dataset**: If you have the dataset in a CSV or similar format, you can load it using a tool like pandas in Python to inspect the column names.

3. **Consult Related Research**: Often, datasets used in research papers are described in the methodology section, which might list all the features.

If you can provide more context or details about the dataset, I might be able to offer more specific guidance. Otherwise, here is a generic Python code snippet to list all column names from a dataset using pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
# df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')

# List all column names
# column_names = df.columns.tolist()
# print(column_names)
```

Replace `'path_to_your_dataset.csv'` with the
Expected:
['Age', 'Gender', 'Hx Radiothreapy', 'Thyroid Function', 'Physical Examination', 'Adenopathy', 'Focality', 'Risk', 'T', 'N', 'Stage', 'Response']
matches:
{'Hx Radiothreapy': False, 'Thyroid Function': False, 'Physical Examination': False, 'Adenopathy': False, 'Focality': False}
decision: False
final decision: False
output:
To provide the remaining feature names from the thyroid disease recurrence dataset, I would need access to the complete dataset or documentation that lists all the features. Since I don't have access to external databases or the internet, I can only help you with the information you provide or general knowledge about typical features in such datasets.

However, I can suggest some common features that might be present in a thyroid disease recurrence dataset based on typical medical datasets:

```python
remaining_features = [
    "Age",
    "Gender",
    "Tumor Size",
    "Histology Type",
    "Surgical Treatment",
    "Thyroid Hormone Levels",
    "TSH Levels",
    "Thyroglobulin Levels",
    "Family History",
    "Previous Thyroid Conditions",
    "Follow-up Duration",
    "Metastasis",
    "Lymph Node Involvement",
    "Treatment Response",
    "Comorbidities"
]
```

Please verify these with the actual dataset or documentation you have, as the specific features can vary depending on the study or data collection methods.
Expected:
['Age', 'Gender', 'Smoking', 'Thyroid Function', 'Pathology', 'Focality', 'Risk', 'T', 'N', 'M', 'Stage', 'Response']
matches:
{'Thyroid Function': False, 'Focality': False}

decision: False
final decision: False




---for dataset MathE
output:
I'm sorry, but I don't have access to the MathE dataset or its specific features. However, I can help you understand how to identify and list features from a dataset if you have access to it. Typically, you would load the dataset into a data analysis tool or library, such as pandas in Python, and then inspect the columns to see all the feature names. If you have the dataset in a CSV file, for example, you could use the following Python code to list all the features:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')

# List all feature names
feature_names = df.columns.tolist()
print(feature_names)
```

If you have more specific information or access to the dataset, I can guide you on how to extract the feature names.
Expected:
['Type of Answer', 'Question Level', 'Subtopic']
matches:
{'Type of Answer': False, 'Question Level': False}
decision: False
final decision: False
output:
To provide the remaining feature names from the MathE dataset, I would need access to the complete dataset or documentation that lists all the features. Since I don't have access to external databases or the internet, I can only work with the information provided. If you have more details or a specific source where the dataset is described, please share it, and I can help you further. Otherwise, you might need to refer to the dataset documentation or metadata to find the complete list of features.
Expected:

decision: False
final decision: False
output:
I'm sorry, but I don't have direct access to external databases or datasets, including the MathE dataset, so I can't provide the remaining feature names directly. However, if you have access to the dataset, you can typically find the feature names by loading the dataset into a data analysis tool or library like pandas in Python and using the `.columns` attribute to list all the column names. If you can provide more context or details about the dataset, I might be able to help you with general advice on how to handle or analyze it.

### VALUES UNINFORMED TEST ###


---for dataset thyroid disease recurrence
output:
To provide the values for the categorical feature "Adenopathy" from the thyroid disease recurrence dataset, you would typically need access to the dataset itself. However, since I don't have direct access to external datasets, I can guide you on how to extract these values using Python if you have the dataset available.

Assuming you have the dataset in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the following code to extract the unique values for the "Adenopathy" feature:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
# df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')  # Adjust the file path and method as needed


Expected:
['Right', 'No', 'Left', 'Extensive', 'Bilateral', 'Posterior']

final decision: False
output:
To provide the values for the categorical feature "Response" from the thyroid disease recurrence dataset, I would need to know the specific dataset you are referring to, as there are multiple datasets related to thyroid disease. However, I can guide you on how to extract unique values from a categorical feature using Python and pandas, assuming you have the dataset loaded into a DataFrame.

Here's a general approach to get the unique values for a categorical feature in a dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame and 'Response' is the column of interest
unique_values = df['Response'].unique()

# Convert

final decision: False




---for dataset MathE
output:
To provide the values for the categorical feature "Question Level" from the MathE dataset, you would typically need to have access to the dataset itself. However, since I don't have direct access to external datasets, I can guide you on how to extract these values if you have the dataset available in a pandas DataFrame.

Here's a general approach using Python and pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Assuming 'df' is your DataFrame containing the MathE dataset
# and 'Question Level' is the column name for the categorical feature

# Extract unique values from the 'Question Level' column
question_level_values = df

I'm sorry, but I don't have direct access to specific datasets like MathE. However, if you have the dataset available, you can easily extract the unique values for the categorical feature "Topic" using Python and libraries like pandas. Here's a general example of how you might do it:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset
# df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')

# Assuming 'Topic' is the name of the column
unique_topics = df['Topic'].unique()

# Convert to a list

### VALUES INFORMED EXAMPLES TEST ###


---for dataset thyroid disease recurrence
output:
Based on the examples provided from the thyroid disease recurrence dataset, the feature "Adenopathy" has the following values:

1. "Right"
2. "No"

These are the values represented in the examples. However, to provide all possible values for the feature "Adenopathy," we would typically need access to the full dataset or documentation that specifies all potential categories. In the absence of such information, we can only list the values observed in the examples. If there are additional categories in the full dataset, they would not be captured here.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the possible values for the feature "Adenopathy
